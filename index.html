  <h2>I am a process engineer with industry and technical knowledge in establishing sustainable systems and processes tailored to organizational scope, goals and business strategies for the last 10 years. I previously worked with Schneider Electric , Verizon, and Accenture where I increased my skills in mapping end to end processes, automation, and understand the common gaps and risks within the operations of business reporting services, order management, supply chain, and bank audit.

    I have passion for learning, business sustainability and simplifying processes to alleviate the conditions of the operations where I had firsthand experience in the past.
